    "content": "# Overview ## The Goal Every time management method needs a clear goal. Without it, there can't be a strategy, only shots in the dark. Also, without a goal, you don't have a criterion to judge whether the method works and you can't find weak spots to improve on. **Goaliath's method aim is to make you proud of your actions** (and to reach serenity, as ancient Stoics would say). ## The Strategy Stated the goal we can design a strategy, a plan of action: 1. **Clearly state our values and goals.** Acting according to them is the best way to feel good about our everyday actions. 2. **Prioritize and defer the less important ones.** Usually, we don't have the time and energy to do all that we commit to. That leads to procrastination, which leads to guilty feelings. The cure to that is prioritization and intentional deferring (not discarding) of the less important goals. 3. **Focus on your actions, not the outcomes.** Focusing on what we control is key to serenity. You don't have full control over whether you'll complete a specific task on a due date. But you do have almost complete control over what you dedicate time to. So our method completely opts out of outcome-focused task lists and only cares about the completion of recurrent activities. 4. **Remember what your values are, and how do you want to dedicate time to them.** Having to decide what to do every day is hard, time and energy-consuming. Moreover, we human beings are inconsistent and tend to end up rowing in a different direction each day, leading to frustration in the long term. So instead of deciding each day, we'll decide once in a while. The rest of the time we'll just remember our previous decision and act according to it. This way we can feel out of responsibility and focus just on doing our best. The next sections explain how the method executes this strategy to help us achieve our goal.

    "content": "# State Your Goals The first time you launch Goaliath it is a blank slate. The first thing to do is to create your goals. > In the app, go to the \"Goals\" section and press the + button to create your first goal. ## Your First Goal What should a goal be? There are multiple options, but it all boils down into: - Something you feel good dedicating time to. - Something you feel bad leaving for tomorrow. In Goaliath, a goal is simply stated by a short descriptive name. Some examples may be: - \"Fitness\" - \"Learn Japanese\" - \"My Novel\" After writing your goal's name, you should think about why are you creating that goal, what motivates you to dedicate time to it. Then put it into the corresponding field of the goal creation screen. It may seem too obvious to write down, but on hard days it is a really good thing to read. As we said in the previous section: *decide less, remember more*. ## Create all your goals After creating your first goal, keep going. Create a goal for each of your meaningful projects and values you want to act on. Keep until you are out of ideas. It's not bad to have too many of them. There is always time to prioritize or even delete some goals if you feel they are not really meaningful to you.

    "content": "# Program Activities When your goals are created it is time to plan the actions you'll take towards each of them. An activity is a recurring action that you take every day or on certain days of the week. >Tap on the first goal to enter its screen. Then press the + button to add its first activity. ## Creating a goal's activities When creating the activities for a goal think about it in an isolated manner. Add the activities that you think will make you feel good about the effort put into it. For example, in a *Learn Japanese* goal you might add the following activities: * Study Vocabulary every day. * Watch a Japanese TV show for two hours each week. * Go to Japanese Lessons each Monday and Friday. * Chat with my Japanese friend once a week. The main goal of the activity list is to ensure that when you complete all activities you will be proud of your efforts. Designing an activity list that yields long term success is also important since you won't be happy if after a year of consistent study you achieve nothing. ## Activity's FAQs What are weekly activities? Daily and select-weekdays activities are fixed on certain days. You have to work out on Monday and Thursday, and if you don't, you miss the workout. If you want to be able to work out any two days of the week, you can set up your activity as weekly, and it will appear every day on the \"This Week\" section on the app, allowing you to do the activity any day of the week. But, what should you use? It depends a lot on personal preferences, but we think that: - Since they are more urgent, daily activities are completed more often. Choose daily what you want to be sure you do. - Weekly activities are more easily deferred, but also they feel better to procrastinate. For this reason, they are a good fit for activities that would be good to do if you have some spare time from your daily ones, but are not critical to you. Should I put a time goal into my activity? Goaliath lets you put time goals into your activities, turning *study vocabulary each day* into *study vocabulary **for one hour** each day*. What should you use depends on whether the activity has a clear end: - The activity *Write my novel* doesn't have one. You could dedicate 1 or 8 hours a day. In this case, the best thing to do is to add a time goal in order to put boundaries to the activity. Choose a duration that will make you proud of the time dedication. Have in mind that you shouldn't be doing much above the goal. Dedicating too much time to an activity will get you exhausted and out of time and energy for other important ones. So choose a goal that is high enough. - The activity *Workout at the gym* is different (if you have a fixed plan on what exercises to do each day). The activity can take more or less time, but it will last just what you need to complete the workout. In this case, you don't want to put a time goal. Just check the activity once you have finished your training (you are still able to start a timer to track how long it takes tapping on the day's activity to see its detail screen). I don't know what activities to do towards this goal. Time dedication activities are good for things you want to do, but you don't know how yet. For example: You want to learn to draw but have no idea how to start. Begin creating a \"Learn to draw\" goal, then a single \"Learn to draw\" activity with a daily time goal of 30 minutes. Even without a clear plan you can dedicate that time to search for online resources, books, a local schol, etc. When that time dedication begins to blossom, you can later replace your \"Learn to draw\" activity by more specific ones like \"Whatch master's youtube videos\", \"practice quick sketching\" and \"Work on my masterpiece\". This is the power of time dedication, to clear the \"I don't know how to start\" mist that leads to eternal deferring of what we want to do. That is why we think time dedication beats tasks or \"what to do\" lists. The former just breeds the latter. How much effort should I put into each goal? The more relevant is that goal for you, the more you'll have to work to feel good about your efforts. Also, avoid thinking about the time you have available when creating activities. Just think about **the time you need to dedicate to be happy** with your efforts on each goal. Thinking \"I don't have much time, so I will just be able to train 1 day a week (even if I think that is not enough)\" will lead to you working for nothing. Be sincere and create activities thinking on the time you need to feel good, not the time you have. Of course, the latter can affect the former! But this first one is the one that matters. What about task lists? For certain goals, you might need task lists to make a plan of action and track your progress. Goaliath does not support traditional task lists, as it is just a tool to help you put in the effort. We believe that adding project management features would harm that main purpose. You'll need to use another tool alongside Goaliath if you need task lists (for simple ones, we are fans of pen and paper). Take this as a brief example: - In Goaliath, you can have the activity *Write my book* for 4 hours each day. Doing that activity ensures you put in the effort that will drive all progress. The exact thing that you write does not matter for Goaliath, and you don't need to edit the activity when you make progress on your book. - You can have the whole novel planned on your computer and mark each chapter as completed while you are dedicating time to your *Write my book* activity.

    "content": "# Prioritization This section of the quick guide talks about prioritization, or what to do when you have too many goals and activities to tackle at once. ## Divide and conquer If you have followed the previous steps in the quick guide now you probably have too many goals with too many activities. If you try to do them all you'll probably find yourself doing everything mid-gas, feeling tired, and blaming yourself for not being able to do it all. You may even be able to work it through one or a couple of weeks out of excitement, but when you get accustomed to it it will become harder and harder. It is better to be realistic and only bite what you can swallow. This is the time for prioritization. Let your scheduling mind awake, and see how much time and effort you would need each day of the week to complete all of the activities. >This is not yet supported but soon Goaliath will allow you to see the total time you need more easily. If you feel it is too much, think about what goals you feel less excited about, and use their switch to disable them. That will avoid its activities to appear. This does not mean that you delete that goal from your life. It is important to you, but now it just is not the right time to do it. You already know what you need to do to work on it, and you can activate it whenever you feel good about it. Why do we do this? Because we feel it is better to work on 30% of your goals at 100% capacity than to work on 100% of your goals at 30% capacity. - In the first case, you'll make advancements and you won't procrastinate much. You'll feel good about your consistency and the effort you are putting in. The paused goals won't bother you much since you have intentionally chosen to defer them. - In the latter case, you will be running trying to do all activities. When you start procrastinating it will become a snowball. Not done activities will be the norm. You won't feel urged to do what you have committed to because it is too much. By the end of the day, you will feel that guilt again. So, make a rough estimate on what you can do right now and keep active just the most important goals. It is better to be conservative because you can turn on a new goal anytime when you feel you are on track with the current ones.

    "content": "# Taking Action ## The day-to-day At this time you'll have a daily reminder of what you have committed to. You'll have an exhaustive list of what you need to do in order to dedicate the right amount of effort to each of your goals. Simple but amazing! Isn't it? The day-to-day is much simpler than the preparation steps. Just look at the \"Today\" screen each morning and try to find time to do what you find there. It is OK if you can't do every activity every day. It is a normal thing to happen, so don't panic. What matters is not what you don't find time to do each day, but what you accomplish to do. That is what drives you forward. Just focus on that. I only recommend reaching for the weekly activities if you really feel like to or if you have already completed your daily ones, and want to work a little more. Look at them just as \"bonus tracks\" for the day. ## What next? ### Retrospectives After some time you'll want to make adjustments to your goals and activities: - Lower the time requirement of an activity that feels like too much to finish consistently. - Rise it for an activity you find yourself doing more time than you programmed, or that you feel is not enough. - Turn down some activities of a goal to put it into \"maintenance mode\" and leave room for other goals - Turn down a goal entirely. - Turn weekly activities into daily ones to give them more relevance, or vice-versa. These are just some examples, but this is a topic for a future guide. [Prev:Priotitization](/guide/prioritization){: .btn .float-left .text-left } ",
