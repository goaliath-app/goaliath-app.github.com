# Prioritization
This section of the quick guide talks about prioritization, or what to do when you have too many goals and activities to tackle at once.

## Divide and conquer
If you have followed the previous steps in the quick guide now you probably have too many goals with too many activities. If you try to do them all you'll probably find yourself doing everithing mid-gas, feeling tired and blaming yourself for not being able to do it all. You may even be able to work it though one or a couple weeks out of excitement, but when you get accustomed to it it will become harder and harder.

It is better to be realist and only bite what you can swallow. This is the time for prioritization.

Let your scheduling mind awake, and see how much time and effort you would need each day of the week to complete all of the activities.

>This is not yet supported, but in the near future Goaliath will allow you to see the total time you need more easily.

If you feel it is to much, think about what goals you feel less excited about, and use their switch to dissable them. That will avoid its activities to appear. 

This does not mean that you delete that goal from your life. It is important to you, but now it just is not the right time to do it. You already know what you need to do to work on it, and you can activate it whenever you feel good about it.

Why do we do this? Because we feel it is better to work on 30% of your goals at 100% capacity than to work on the 100% of your goals at 30% capacity.
  - In the first case, you'll make advancements and you won't procrastinate much. You'll feel good about your consistency and the effort you are putting in. The paused goals won't bother you much since you have intentionaly chosen to defer them.
  - In the latter case, you will be running trying to do all activities. When you start procrastinating it will become a snowball. Not done activities will be the norm. You won't feel urged to do what you have commited to because it is too much. By the end of the day you will feel that guilt again.

So, make a rough estimate on what you can do right now and keep active just the most important goals. It is better to be conservative, because you can turn on a new goal anytime when you feel you are on track with the current ones and you can tackle another.
