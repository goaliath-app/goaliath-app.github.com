# Taking Action
## The day-to-day
At this time you'll have a daily reminder of what you have committed to. You'll have an exhaustive list of what you need to do in order to dedicate the right amount of effort to each of your goals. Simple but amazing! Isn't it?

The day-to-day is much simpler than the preparation steps. Just look at the "Today" screen each morning and try to find time to do what you find there.

It is OK if you can't do every activity every day. It is a normal thing to happen, so don't panic. What matters is not what you don't find time to do each day, but what you accomplish to do. That is what drives you forward. Just focus on that.

I only recommend reaching for the weekly activities if you really feel like to or if you have already completed your daily ones, and want to work a little more. Look at them just as "bonus tracks" for the day.

## What next?
Retrospectives
After some time you'll want to make adjustments to your goals and activities:
  - Lower the time requirement of an activity that feels like too much to finish consistently.
  - Rise it for an activity you find yourself doing more time than you programmed, or that you feel is not enough.
  - Turn down some activities of a goal to put it into "maintenance mode" and leave room for other goals
  - Turn down a goal entirely.
  - Turn weekly activities into daily ones to give them more relevance, or vice-versa.

These are just some examples, but this is a topic for a future guide.
