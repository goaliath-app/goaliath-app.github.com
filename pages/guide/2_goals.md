# State Your Goals
The first time you launch Goaliath it is a blank slate. The first thing to do is to create your goals. In the app, go to the "Goals" section and press the + button to create your first goal. 

## Your First Goal
What should a goal be? There are multiple options, but it all boils down into:
- Something you feel good dedicating time to.  
- Something you feel bad leaving for tomorrow.
  
In Goaliath, a goal is simply stated by a short descriptive name. Some examples may be:
- Fitness
- Learn Japanese
- My Novel

After writing your goal's name, you should think about why are you creating that goal, what motivates you to dedicate time to it. Then put it into the corresponding field of the goal creation screen.<br>
It may seem too obvious to write down, but on hard days it is a really good thing to read. As we said in the previous section: *decide less, remember more*.

## Create all of them
After creating your first goal, keep going. Create a goal for each of your meaningful projects and values you want to act on. Keep until you are out of ideas. 

It's not bad to have too many of them. There is always time to prioritize or even delete some goals if you feel they are not really meaningful to you.
